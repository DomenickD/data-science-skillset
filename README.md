# Data Science: Zero to Hero

Welcome to **Data Science: Zero to Hero**, a comprehensive, hands-on course designed to take you from absolute beginner to advanced practitioner. Over the lessons ahead, you'll build your skills step-by-step and apply them to a growing chatbot project that culminates in a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM using LangChain and Llama3.2+. Alongside the chatbot, you will explore foundational machine learning projects: Titanic classification, Ames Housing regression, and MNIST digit recognition.
